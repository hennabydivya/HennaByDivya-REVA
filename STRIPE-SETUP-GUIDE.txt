💳 STRIPE PAYMENT SETUP GUIDE
================================

Your shop page is ready! Now let's connect Stripe for payments.

📋 OPTION 1: STRIPE PAYMENT LINKS (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------------------------------

This is the simplest way to accept payments without any backend code!

Step 1: Create a Stripe Account
   → Go to: https://stripe.com/
   → Click "Start now" and create your account
   → Verify your email and complete business information

Step 2: Create a Product
   → Log into Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
   → Click "Products" in the left menu
   → Click "Add product"
   → Fill in:
      - Name: Premium Henna Cone
      - Price: $12.00 USD (or your price)
      - Upload product image

Step 3: Create a Payment Link
   → In your product page, click "Create payment link"
   → Customize options (quantity, success message, etc.)
   → Click "Create link"
   → Copy the payment link (looks like: https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx)

Step 4: Add to Your Website
   → Open: shop-checkout.js
   → Find the section that says "STRIPE PAYMENT LINKS"
   → Uncomment that code (remove the /* and */)
   → Paste your payment link
   → Comment out the regular checkout code above it

Done! Your shop is now live! 🎉


📋 OPTION 2: STRIPE CHECKOUT (ADVANCED)
----------------------------------------

This requires setting up a backend server. Only use if you're comfortable with coding.

Step 1-2: Same as Option 1 (Create account and get API keys)

Step 3: Get Your API Keys
   → In Stripe Dashboard, go to "Developers" → "API keys"
   → Copy your "Publishable key" (starts with pk_test_ or pk_live_)
   → Open: shop-checkout.js
   → Replace 'pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE' with your actual key

Step 4: Set Up Backend
   → You'll need a server (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)
   → Create an endpoint: /create-checkout-session
   → Follow Stripe's documentation: https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart
